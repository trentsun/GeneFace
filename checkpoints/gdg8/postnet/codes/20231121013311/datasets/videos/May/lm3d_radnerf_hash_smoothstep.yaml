# The occupancy grid works fine in LEGO dataset. (~10x accelerated)
# In my experiment (and on my dataset), I found that occupancy grid sampling is vulnerable to scale.
# In specific scale range, the occ grid sampling works and accelerates rendering.
# But outside of that range, the acceleration gain disappears, or it fails to converge at all.
# (Without the occ grid sampling, the model has learned the scene in that scales.)
# I think this is reasonable because covering the the camera-viewed region with a predefined grid 
# is easier to fail than sampling without grids.
# With an manual scale tuning, I can get the expected acceleration gain.
